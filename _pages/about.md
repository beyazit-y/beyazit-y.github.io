# About

I am a 4th-year computer science Ph.D. student at University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Sanjit A. Seshia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/). In 2020, I received my B.Sc. in computer engineering from [Middle East Technical University](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) in Ankara, Turkey, where I was advised by [Ebru Aydin Gol](https://cps.ceng.metu.edu.tr/people/ebru-aydin-gol/) as an undergraduate research assistant for three years. In the summer of 2018, I was a research intern at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) in Kaiserslautern, Germany, advised by [Björn B. Brandenburg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/). In 2019, I interned at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), where I was advised by [George Candea](https://dslab.epfl.ch/people/candea/).

# Research

I work on artificial intelligence (AI) and formal methods, focusing on AI safety and aligment with  Frege’s principle (also called compositionality) in mind. I pursue two major directions: (i) developing compositional formal analysis techniques for the scalable verification of black-box systems, and (ii) designing learning frameworks that leverage the compositional and well-defined semantics of formal models.

# Teaching

- In the Fall 2022 semester, I served as a graduate student instructor for EECS 149/249A: Introduction to Embedded Systems at University of California, Berkeley.
- In the Fall 2017 semester, I served as an undergraduate teaching assistant for CENG 230: Introduction to C Programming at Middle East Technical University.
